# The Button
Console Monitoring made for The Mighty Button

It's a node.js application ready to be used as-is with redis (local server):

    npm install

Redis usage is only to store clicks and lowest second recorded. If you don't want to use this feature, make sure to disable the options to save and load (from the main.js).

Enjoy.
